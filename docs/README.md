# Docs Directory

This directory holds long-term, agent-focused documentation for this repo. It is not intended for human readers and is committed to git. Repo-wide rules live in `AGENTS.md`; this directory should only add durable, cross-cutting guidance that does not belong in code comments or tests.

Keep docs evergreen and aligned with the codebase. For doc-writing rules and plan/scratch policy, follow `AGENTS.md` and `docs/decisions.md`.
