# techdebt

## Overview

This is a thin alias for the `cleanup` skill, focused on technical debt reduction.

## Workflow

1. Load and follow `../cleanup/SKILL.md`.
2. Prioritize tech-debt, bloat, redundancy, and maintainability concerns as directed by `cleanup`.
3. If there is any mismatch, prefer the canonical `cleanup` skill instructions.
