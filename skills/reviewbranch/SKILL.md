# reviewbranch

## Overview

This is a thin alias for the `gitreview` skill.

## Workflow

1. Load and follow `../gitreview/SKILL.md`.
2. Apply the `gitreview` workflow end-to-end without adding a second, conflicting process.
3. If there is any mismatch, prefer the canonical `gitreview` skill instructions.
