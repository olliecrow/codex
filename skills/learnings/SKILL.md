# learnings

## Overview

This is a thin alias for the `organise-docs` skill, focused on quickly turning active notes into durable repository knowledge.

## Workflow

1. Load and follow `../organise-docs/SKILL.md`.
2. Prioritize note routing, de-duplication, and durable promotion of reusable learnings.
3. If there is any mismatch, prefer the canonical `organise-docs` instructions.
