  short_description: "Create and file reports directly in Notion"
  default_prompt: "Create a report directly in Notion using the local notion-local MCP API tools, filed under the appropriate project hub. Preserve detail, include tables, and embed plots/images using Notion-managed uploads by default. For comparative experiment reports, explicitly describe eval-time setup in plain English: checkpoint/snapshot evaluated, eval composition/overrides, what is fixed versus randomized at eval (including fees and starting capital when relevant), and whether the comparison is apples-to-apples or not. Do not use third-party public/temporary hosts (for example tmpfiles.org/catbox/imgur/file.io) unless the user explicitly approves. If upload is unavailable in the current toolchain, add an Artifacts to attach section and return the page URL."
