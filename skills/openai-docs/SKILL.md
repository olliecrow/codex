# OpenAI Docs

Provide authoritative, current guidance from OpenAI developer docs using the developers.openai.com MCP server. Always prioritize the developer docs MCP tools over web.run for OpenAI-related questions. Only if the MCP server is installed and returns no meaningful results should you fall back to web search.

## Multi-agent collaboration

- Encourage use of multiple agents/subagents when it is likely to improve speed, quality, or confidence.
- Split work into clear packets with owners, inputs, acceptance checks, and a synthesis step when parallelizing.
- Use single-agent execution when scope is small or coordination overhead outweighs gains.

## Proactive autonomy and knowledge compounding

- Be proactive: immediately take the next highest-value in-scope action when it is clear.
- Default to autonomous execution: do not pause for confirmation between normal in-scope steps.
- Request user input only when absolutely necessary: ambiguous requirements, material risk tradeoffs, missing required data/access, or destructive/irreversible actions outside policy.
- If blocked by command/tool/env failures, attempt high-confidence fallbacks autonomously before escalating (for example `rg` -> `find`/`grep`, `python` -> `python3`, alternate repo-native scripts).
- When the workflow uses `plan/`, ensure required plan directories exist before reading/writing them (create when edits are allowed; otherwise use an in-memory fallback and call it out).
- Treat transient external failures (network/SSH/remote APIs/timeouts) as retryable by default: run bounded retries with backoff and capture failure evidence before concluding blocked.
- On repeated invocations for the same objective, resume from prior findings/artifacts and prioritize net-new progress over rerunning identical work unless verification requires reruns.
- Drive work to complete outcomes with verification, not partial handoffs.
- Treat iterative execution as the default for non-trivial work; run adaptive loop passes. Example loops (adapt as needed, not rigid): issue-resolution `investigate -> plan -> fix -> verify -> battletest -> organise-docs -> git-commit -> re-review`; cleanup `scan -> prioritize -> clean -> verify -> re-scan`; docs `audit -> update -> verify -> re-audit`.
- Keep looping until actual completion criteria are met: no actionable in-scope items remain, verification is green, and confidence is high.
- Run `organise-docs` frequently during execution to capture durable decisions and learnings, not only at the end.
- Create small checkpoint commits frequently with `git-commit` when changes are commit-eligible, checks are green, and repo policy permits commits.
- Never squash commits; always use merge commits when integrating branches.
- Compound knowledge continuously: keep `docs/` accurate and up to date, and promote durable learnings and decisions from work into docs.

## Long-task checkpoint cadence

- For any non-trivial task (including long efforts), run recurring checkpoint cycles instead of waiting for a single end-of-task wrap-up.
- At each meaningful milestone with commit-eligible changes, and at least once per major phase, invoke `git-commit` to create a small logical checkpoint commit once relevant checks are green and repo policy permits commits.
- At the same cadence, invoke `organise-docs` whenever durable learnings/decisions appear, and prune stale `plan/` scratch artifacts.
- If either checkpoint is blocked (for example failing checks or low-confidence documentation), resolve or record the blocker immediately and retry before expanding scope.

## Quick start

- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__search_openai_docs` to find the most relevant doc pages.
- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__fetch_openai_doc` to pull exact sections and quote/paraphrase accurately.
- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__list_openai_docs` only when you need to browse or discover pages without a clear query.

## OpenAI product snapshots

1. Apps SDK: Build ChatGPT apps by providing a web component UI and an MCP server that exposes your app's tools to ChatGPT.
2. Responses API: A unified endpoint designed for stateful, multimodal, tool-using interactions in agentic workflows.
3. Chat Completions API: Generate a model response from a list of messages comprising a conversation.
4. Codex: OpenAI's coding agent for software development that can write, understand, review, and debug code.
5. gpt-oss: Open-weight OpenAI reasoning models (gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b) released under the Apache 2.0 license.
6. Realtime API: Build low-latency, multimodal experiences including natural speech-to-speech conversations.
7. Agents SDK: A toolkit for building agentic apps where a model can use tools and context, hand off to other agents, stream partial results, and keep a full trace.

## If MCP server is missing

If MCP tools fail or no OpenAI docs resources are available:

1. Run the install command yourself: `codex mcp add openaiDeveloperDocs --url https://developers.openai.com/mcp`
2. If it fails, retry with local fallbacks (verify `codex` path, check existing MCP config, and retry once after a short backoff).
3. If MCP still cannot be enabled, continue autonomously using restricted web fallback on official OpenAI domains (`developers.openai.com`, `platform.openai.com`) so the task still completes.
4. Ask the user to install/restart only when they want persistent MCP availability beyond the current response.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the product scope (Codex, OpenAI API, or ChatGPT Apps SDK) and the task.
2. Search docs with a precise query.
3. Fetch the best page and the specific section needed (use `anchor` when possible).
4. Answer with concise guidance and cite the doc source.
5. Provide code snippets only when the docs support them.

## Quality rules

- Treat OpenAI docs as the source of truth; avoid speculation.
- Keep quotes short and within policy limits; prefer paraphrase with citations.
- If multiple pages differ, call out the difference and cite both.
- If docs do not cover the user’s need, say so and offer next steps.

## Tooling notes

- Always use MCP doc tools before any web search for OpenAI-related questions.
- If the MCP server is installed but returns no meaningful results, then use web search as a fallback.
- When falling back to web search, restrict to official OpenAI domains (developers.openai.com, platform.openai.com) and cite sources.
